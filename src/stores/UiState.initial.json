    "defaultMarkdown": "This is intended as a quick reference and showcase. For more complete info, see [John Gruber's original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).\n\nThis cheatsheet is specifically *Markdown Here's* version of Github-flavored Markdown. This differs slightly in styling and syntax from what Github uses, so what you see below might vary a little from what you get in a *Markdown Here* email, but it should be pretty close.\n\nYou can play around with Markdown on our [live demo page](http://www.markdown-here.com/livedemo.html).\n\n(If you're not a Markdown Here user, check out the [Markdown Cheatsheet](./Markdown-Cheatsheet) that is not specific to MDH. But, really, you should also use Markdown Here, because it's awesome. http://markdown-here.com)\n\n<a name=\"headers\"/>\n\n## Headers\n\n```no-highlight\n# H1\n## H2\n### H3\n#### H4\n##### H5\n###### H6\n\nAlternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:\n\nAlt-H1\n======\n\nAlt-H2\n------\n```\n\n# H1\n## H2\n### H3\n#### H4\n##### H5\n###### H6\n\nAlternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:\n\nAlt-H1\n======\n\nAlt-H2\n------\n\n<a name=\"emphasis\"/>\n\n## Emphasis\n\n```no-highlight\nEmphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.\n\nStrong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.\n\nCombined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.\n\nStrikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~\n```\n\nEmphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.\n\nStrong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.\n\nCombined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.\n\nStrikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~\n\n\n<a name=\"lists\"/>\n\n## Lists\n\n```no-highlight\n1.

However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n```no-highlight\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n```\n\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.\n\n<pre lang=\"no-highlight\"><code>```javascript\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n```\n \n```python\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n```\n \n```\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. \nBut let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.\n```\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n```javascript\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n```\n\n```python\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n```\n\n```\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github). \nBut let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.\n```\n\nAgain, to see what languages are available for highlighting, and how to write those language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n<a name=\"tables\"/>\n\n## Tables\n\nTables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and *Markdown Here* supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.\n\n```no-highlight\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\n\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.\n\nMarkdown | Less | Pretty\n--- | --- | ---\n*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**\n1 | 2 | 3\n```\n\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\n\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.\n\nMarkdown | Less | Pretty\n--- | --- | ---\n*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**\n1 | 2 | 3\n\n<a name=\"blockquotes\"/>\n\n## Blockquotes\n\n```no-highlight\n> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\n> This line is part of the same quote.\n\nQuote break.\n\n> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. \n```\n\n> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\n> This line is part of the same quote.\n\nQuote break.\n\n> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. \n\n<a name=\"html\"/>\n\n## Inline HTML\n\nYou can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well. \n\n```no-highlight\n<dl>\n  <dt>Definition list</dt>\n  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>\n  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>\n</dl>\n```\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>Definition list</dt>\n  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>\n  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<a name=\"hr\"/>\n\n## Horizontal Rule\n\n```\nThree or more...\n\n---\n\nHyphens\n\n***\n\nAsterisks\n\n___\n\nUnderscores\n```\n\nThree or more...\n\n---\n\nHyphens\n\n***\n\nAsterisks\n\n___\n\nUnderscores\n\n<a name=\"lines\"/>\n\n## Line Breaks\n\nMy basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit &lt;Enter&gt; once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. \"Markdown Toggle\" is your friend. \n\nHere are some things to try out:\n\n```\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line is also a separate paragraph, but...\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n```\n\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line is also begins a separate paragraph, but...  \nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n\n(Technical note: *Markdown Here* uses GFM line breaks, so there's no need to use MD's two-space line breaks.)\n\n<a name=\"videos\"/>\n\n## YouTube Videos\n\nThey can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:\n\n```no-highlight\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg\" \nalt=\"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\n```\n\nOr, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:\n\n```no-highlight\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)\n```\n\n<a name=\"tex\"/>\n\n## TeX Mathematical Formulae\n\nA full description of TeX math symbols is beyond the scope of this cheatsheet. Here's a [good reference](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics), and you can try stuff out on [CodeCogs](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php). You can also play with formulae in the Markdown Here options page.\n\nHere are some examples to try out:\n\n```\n$-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \\over 2a$\n$x = a_0 + \\frac{1}{a_1 + \\frac{1}{a_2 + \\frac{1}{a_3 + a_4}}}$\n$\\forall x \\in X, \\quad \\exists y \\leq \\epsilon$\n```\n\nThe beginning and ending dollar signs (`$`) are the delimiters for the TeX markup.\n"
